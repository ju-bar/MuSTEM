Quick Start Information for muSTEM
----------------------------------

The minimum needed to run muSTEM is

1) a program control file "user_input.txt", and

2) an XTL file with a structure model.

A simulation text file is optional and can be recorded on the first run.


GPU and CPU compile version differ in the format of control files.


Program options
----------------

options
	Lists available program options for the command-line.
nopause
	Skips all input pausing.
ionic
	Applies ionic potentials and expects charge data in the XTL file.
linpoleels
	Applies linear interpolation of energy-loss ranges instead of cubic splines.
omp_num_threads={number}
	Sets number of OpenMP threads.



Program control file options
----------------------------

Line 1:
interactive:
	No recording or playing, all inputs taken from the console
record:
	As above, but does not overwrite the listed simulation file
	if it exists.
record overwrite:
	Records the simulation file based on console inputs.
	Overwrites the listed simulation file (if it exists).
play:
	Plays the listed simulation file with no input via console needed.
